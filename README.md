# Teams
Android "Teams" Application

# Intended Purpose
This application is a basic utility to make game nights go more smoothly.  It can divide players up into teams, or determine what order the players will play in.

# Teams
The 'Teams' function will divide players into even teams.  If there is an odd number of players one person will be selected at random to play on two teams.  I plan to update this in a future version, and have that as an available setting.

# Shuffle
Self-explanatory.  This function will simple shuffle the players to determine what order the game will be played in.
